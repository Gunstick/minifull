# minifull
A simple fullscreen routine without interrupts

also includes a fast running development environment with hatari for linux

Just run ./autohatari.sh fulltest.s

And it should auto-initialize a hatari save file for the project

Then each time you change the source, hatari will be restarted with
the new executable in less than 1 second
